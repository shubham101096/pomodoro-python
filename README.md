# pomodoro-python
This project helps us to work for longer durations with help of regular break intervals. It implements pomodoro time management method (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). It uses tkinter pyhton library.


The person works for 25 min before taking a break. A checkmark is added at bottom for each of his work repition.
